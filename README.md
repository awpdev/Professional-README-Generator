# Professional-README-Generator [![License: Unlicense](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Unlicense-blue.svg)](http://unlicense.org/)

## Description
This is a README generator that uses the command line interface. It uses the inquirer npm package to ask the user about the important aspects of their project, then using the responses by user, creates a README in a markdown format.

The program is able to generate with the following sections so far: description, table of contents, installation (optional), usage (optional), contributing (optional), tests (optional), questions, and license.
